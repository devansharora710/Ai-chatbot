# AI Voice Agent (CPaaS)
### Team: <span style="color: #E21683;">Barbie</span>
#### Event: UDYAM'26 - DevBits
A contextual, low-latency AI receptionist and sales agent, capable of handling interruptions and generating Minutes of Meeting (MoM).



## Overview
This project is an **AI-Powered Customer Engagement Platform** designed to automate Inbound and Outbound calls for a real estate company ("Barbie Builders"). The system acts as a Smart Receptionist that qualifies leads, answers queries about properties (Apartments, Villas, Plots), and automatically generates a PDF summary of the conversation.

##  Key Features
* **Contextual Intelligence:** Powered by **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, the agent understands location context and user intent.
* **Low Latency:** Uses streaming responses (Piper TTS + Gemini Streaming) to achieve conversational speeds < 2 seconds.
* **Barge-In Support:** The agent stops speaking immediately if the user interrupts, mimicking natural human conversation.
* **Automated MoM:** Generates a structured **Minutes of Meeting PDF** containing customer details, budget, and action items immediately after the call.
* **Full Duplex Audio:** Utilizes Asterisk External Media (RTP) for raw audio processing.



## Architecture

**Data Flow:**
1.  **Telephony:** Asterisk handles the SIP call.
2.  **Audio Stream:** Audio is piped via RTP (External Media) to `whisper_listener.py`.
3.  **STT:** **Faster-Whisper** with **Silero VAD** transcribes speech and detects interruptions.
4.  **Brain:** The transcript is sent to **Gemini 2.5 Flash**, which streams a text response.
5.  **TTS:** **Piper** (running locally) converts the text stream to audio and sends RTP packets back to Asterisk.
6.  **Orchestrator:** `ari.py` manages the call state via WebSocket.
